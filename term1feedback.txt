Your project administration looks good overall. Just commit to Github more regularly. The video walk through is getting there. Start with the user journey on the website and then move to the code. With the code highlighting specific pieces that are more complex and walk through them line by line rather than just showing all of your code. Your header section on your homepage is a bit long, just make sure that it is set to 100vh. The links in the footer section should be more center aligned and the social media links are a bit far apart. Just link those social media pages to open windows social media accounts. The flights page looks good. Your images just need to be a little bit bigger. The information below the horizontal lines also needs to be a normal column based format. On the contact page the spacing around the social media icons are a bit big. Make them a bit smaller. The form is also not long enough. Overall it is a very good project. If you make these small changes it will become a distinction project. See if you can add a few more interactive elements.
